# About MusicSync  
A website that syncs its theme with the beat and tone of a particular song

# Stack  
I’m probably going to use React for the front end. If a backend is needed, I would likely go with NextJS

# External APIs  
This project would rely on the Shazam API to look up the songs. Additionally, some music with the capacity to fetch a song’s notes would be useful to identify the beat and tone.
